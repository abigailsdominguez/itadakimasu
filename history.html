						<p>The history of Japanese cuisine is very much a large part of the Japanese culture, and an integral part of the Japanese people’s lives. Through the years, it has developed unique characteristics and has become well-known in most parts of the world. Over the recent years, more and more Japanese restaurants have proliferated.</p>

						<p>Many of Japan’s cultural and even culinary traditions came from China and Korea. The most important of these is rice, which only arrived in Japan at the end of the Neolithic Period, about 2,400 years ago, with immigrants that came from the mainland.</p>

						<p>Before that, in the Jomon Era, the Japanese were still hunters and gatherers. The original inhabitants or <em>Ainu</em> were Caucasian. Asiatic people came later from the continent and they brought with them rice and metal tools; and then suddenly, like everywhere else, the population rose.</p>

        							<p>The variety of rice introduced was short-grained, sticky, and it is somewhat sweet. To this day, the Japanese don’t really eat long-grain rice. Much of their cuisine is based on the tactile quality of the rice that they use and the fact that it sticks together—you can pick it up with a chopstick.</p>
        							<p>The respect and reverence afforded to rice is so great that it is not flavored or seasoned with spices or sauces, it is always white and boiled. Other foods may be added on top of rice, but the rice should be pure and bland to start with. This is a kind of respect for the natural flavor and aroma that the rice has on its own, as nature made it.</p>
        							<p>The only traditional preparation that really alters the rice dramatically is Mochi, little rice cakes that are made by pounding steamed glutinous rice with these huge hammers. The idea here is you’re concentrating the pure spirit of the rice and actually making it purer, it is an intensification, and Mochi is one of those things that you consume on New Year’s, it is a very important festival.</p>

        							<p>This entire cuisine was based on fish. Only strict Buddhist monks avoided fish. Here, the topography works perfectly to their advantage.</p>
        							<p>Japan’s surrounded by water; you’re never very far from the sea. The ideal became fish as fresh as could possibly be found—unlike Europe where most of the fish was salted, pickled, or preserved in some way.</p>
        							<p>In Europe, only the very wealthy could afford fresh fish. In Japan, even far from the coast, people wanted fresh fish, no matter if it had to be freshwater fish. The simpler the better; there’s a saying:</p>
        							<p>“Eat it raw first, then grill it, and boil it as a last resort.” The idea is you don’t want to ruin the flavor of the fish. The raw fish, of course, was cut in thin slices (namasu); that’s always been eaten in Japan.</p>
        							<p>The practice of dipping what we now call sashimi in soy sauce with wasabi is really only a 17th-century invention; and the act serves to mask the pure flavors of the fish, especially if you’re talking about something very delicate.</p>

        							<p>There are a slew of vegetables: Daikon radish is probably the one most familiar to you, cut into impossibly thin sticks. If you’ve seen someone do this, it is absolutely amazing.</p>
        							<p>The Daikon is sliced with a long knife and as it is sliced, it is turned, and so you get this long, thin ribbon cut from the root with this very narrow blade, and then that’s sliced and cut into tiny little sticks. Daikon can also be pickled yellow.</p>
        							<p>Pickling is really popular in traditional Japanese cooking, but it is usually very simple salt fermentation; it is not vinegar cured with dill and garlic like we’d do a cucumber pickle. The pickles come at the end of a Japanese meal, and they contrast with the blander flavor of rice.</p>
        							<p>Soybeans are also clearly central. They’re eaten boiled and cold as edamame. They’re made into tofu, which was introduced from China from about the 11th century and, for Buddhist monks, serve as a wonderful source of protein.</p>
        							<p>Soy’s also made into miso paste, which is a fermented, storable seasoning for boiled dishes, for soup, and it is really kind of a universal flavoring also. It is made by boiling and mashing the beans and then introducing a fungus that grows on rice grains and salt, and you just leave it and let it mature for about a year or so.</p>
